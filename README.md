# [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) handler for [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog)

Support for logging into Apache Kafka using [rdkafka extension](https://github.com/arnaud-lb/php-rdkafka) (there are a few libraries for PHP, but this once seems to be most mature and supports Kafka versions 0.8, 0.9 & 0.10).
